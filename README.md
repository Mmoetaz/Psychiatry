# Psychiatry
Creating a static website using Html Css and JS basics:
I made a web app usng Html Css and Js basics the first page(Home page) there is the nav element ==> where you can navigate to the help and about us page
--> the nav is animated in css by using :hover keyword 
+ connexion button with a loglogo taking you directly to the sign in page and you can choose to sign up if you don't have an account.
+there is two paragraphs.
+finally the footer which is the same in all pages.
*1st Page: Index.html ==> I tried to make this page responsive using the metadata in Html and changing its layout with CSS.
The site is a static web (didn't use PHP and SQL ==> there is no communication with servers) it's just for applying some static web basics.
Finally, there is two test pages (dementia & depression) it gives you a mark/100 and tell you if you have to visit a doc!.
+there is a paiment page (not responsive!) that oblige you to choose a paiment method.


WHY DID I CHOOSE THIS IDEA?
1) There is a lot of people who feel shy about visiting a Psychiatrist.
2) There is a lot of psychiatrist suffering of the problem of unemployment.
3) It's more comfortable for both Psychiatrist(Remote work) and Patient(Remote consultation).
